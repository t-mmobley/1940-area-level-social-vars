# 1940-area-level-social-vars
This repository includes all of the necessary code to create 1940 area-level social factors using full count 1940 Census microdata from IPUMS. The data are publicly available with agreement to special usage terms and can be found here: (https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/samples#usa_100_percent)

Collectively, the code produces a clean area-level 1940 census data set with social indicators (e.g., area-level education) and common measures of segregation, including the dissimilarity index and three ICE measures. With a few exceptions, the indicators are constructed at the county, metropolitan, and enumeration district level. Finally, area-level social factors are constructed (1) overall and (2) race-stratified for Black and White US populations.
